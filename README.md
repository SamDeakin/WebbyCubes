# WebbyCubes
Create stuff with cubes in your web browser! Put the monocolour cubes together to create whatever you want!

## How to run
Clone, then use whatever simple webserver is your favourite. Personally I like `python3 -m http.server 1337`

This is written in fairly modern but vanilla javascript using modules, which is why the server is required. The graphics portions use WebGL 2 and GLSL ES 3.0, so they probably won't run on an iPhone or in Safari right now.
